# FrF2mix

The PLAN P project - spectral tools and digitalisation for the development of sustainable structured food with plant proteins - aims to develop a smart and innovative system in order to design sustainable food and control quality online during production and shelf life. In order to accelerate the plant food transition, a digital solution will be developed for the conception and production of sustainable food based on plant proteins.

This R package proposes a simple, generic and efficient approach to combine process and mixture factors in the same design by handing easily any mixture constraint for 3 ingredients in the frame of fractional factorial designs based on Rytz et al. (2017). Thus, we implemented computational functions in R allowing to quickly obtain fractional factorial designs with mixing constraints by associating two existing R packages (i.e. FrF2 and mixexp) to define the experimental designs in order to obtain products with different microstructures.

This project has received funding provided by national sources (Regional council of Brittany, France; GUDP, Denmark; GSRI, Greece) and co-funding from the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under grant agreement No 862665 ICT-AGRI-FOOD.
